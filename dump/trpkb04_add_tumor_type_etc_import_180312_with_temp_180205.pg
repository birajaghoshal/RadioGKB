1	CCND1	595	{BCL1," D11S287E"," PRAD1"," U21B31"}	cyclin D1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4 or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, amplification and overexpression of this gene, which alters cell cycle progression, are observed frequently in a variety of tumors and may contribute to tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
2	BIRC5	332	{API4," EPR-1"}	baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5	protein-coding	This gene is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family, which encode negative regulatory proteins that prevent apoptotic cell death. IAP family members usually contain multiple baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, but this gene encodes proteins with only a single BIR domain. The encoded proteins also lack a C-terminus RING finger domain. Gene expression is high during fetal development and in most tumors, yet low in adult tissues. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].
3	XRCC4	7518	{SSMED}	X-ray repair cross complementing 4	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene functions together with DNA ligase IV and the DNA-dependent protein kinase in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. This protein plays a role in both non-homologous end joining and the completion of V(D)J recombination. Mutations in this gene can cause short stature, microcephaly, and endocrine dysfunction (SSMED). Alternative splicing generates several transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015].
4	XRCC5	7520	{KARP-1," KARP1"," KU80"," KUB2"," Ku86"," NFIV"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 5	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is the 80-kilodalton subunit of the Ku heterodimer protein which is also known as ATP-dependant DNA helicase II or DNA repair protein XRCC5. Ku is the DNA-binding component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, and it functions together with the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex in the repair of DNA double-strand break by non-homologous end joining and the completion of V(D)J recombination events.  This gene functionally complements Chinese hamster xrs-6, a mutant defective in DNA double-strand break repair and in ability to undergo V(D)J recombination. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
5	XRCC6	2547	{CTC75," CTCBF"," G22P1"," KU70"," ML8"," TLAA"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 6	protein-coding	The p70/p80 autoantigen is a nuclear complex consisting of two subunits with molecular masses of approximately 70 and 80 kDa. The complex functions as a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP-dependent helicase. The complex may be involved in the repair of nonhomologous DNA ends such as that required for double-strand break repair, transposition, and V(D)J recombination. High levels of autoantibodies to p70 and p80 have been found in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
6	PRKDC	5591	{DNA-PKcs," DNAPK"," DNPK1"," HYRC"," HYRC1"," IMD26"," XRCC7"," p350"}	protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide	protein-coding	This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). It functions with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer protein in DNA double strand break repair and recombination. The protein encoded is a member of the PI3/PI4-kinase family.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010].
7	LIG4	3981	{LIG4S}	DNA ligase 4	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a DNA ligase that joins single-strand breaks in a double-stranded polydeoxynucleotide in an ATP-dependent reaction. This protein is essential for V(D)J recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). This protein forms a complex with the X-ray repair cross complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), and further interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Both XRCC4 and DNA-PK are known to be required for NHEJ. The crystal structure of the complex formed by this protein and XRCC4 has been resolved. Defects in this gene are the cause of LIG4 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
8	DCLRE1C	64421	{A-SCID," DCLREC1C"," RS-SCID"," SCIDA"," SNM1C"}	DNA cross-link repair 1C	protein-coding	This gene encodes a nuclear protein that is involved in V(D)J recombination and DNA repair. The encoded protein has single-strand-specific 5'-3' exonuclease activity; it also exhibits endonuclease activity on 5' and 3' overhangs and hairpins. The protein also functions in the regulation of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Mutations in this gene can cause Athabascan-type severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA) and Omenn syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014].
9	APEX1	328	{APE," APE1"," APEN"," APEX"," APX"," HAP1"," REF1"}	apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1	protein-coding	Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites occur frequently in DNA molecules by spontaneous hydrolysis, by DNA damaging agents or by DNA glycosylases that remove specific abnormal bases. AP sites are pre-mutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication so the cell contains systems to identify and repair such sites. Class II AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the AP site. This gene encodes the major AP endonuclease in human cells. Splice variants have been found for this gene; all encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
10	XRCC1	7515	{RCC," SCAR26"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the efficient repair of DNA single-strand breaks formed by exposure to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. This protein interacts with DNA ligase III, polymerase beta and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase to participate in the base excision repair pathway. It may play a role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
29	RB1	5925	{OSRC," PPP1R130"," RB"," p105-Rb"," pRb"," pp110"}	RB transcriptional corepressor 1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a negative regulator of the cell cycle and was the first tumor suppressor gene found. The encoded protein also stabilizes constitutive heterochromatin to maintain the overall chromatin structure. The active, hypophosphorylated form of the protein binds transcription factor E2F1. Defects in this gene are a cause of childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB), bladder cancer, and osteogenic sarcoma. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
11	ERCC1	2067	{COFS4," RAD10"," UV20"}	ERCC excision repair 1, endonuclease non-catalytic subunit	protein-coding	The product of this gene functions in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, and is required for the repair of DNA lesions such as those induced by UV light or formed by electrophilic compounds including cisplatin. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the XPF endonuclease (also known as ERCC4), and the heterodimeric endonuclease catalyzes the 5' incision in the process of excising the DNA lesion. The heterodimeric endonuclease is also involved in recombinational DNA repair and in the repair of inter-strand crosslinks. Mutations in this gene result in cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome, and polymorphisms that alter expression of this gene may play a role in carcinogenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The last exon of this gene overlaps with the CD3e molecule, epsilon associated protein gene on the opposite strand. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009].
12	EGFR	1956	{ERBB," ERBB1"," HER1"," NISBD2"," PIG61"," mENA"}	epidermal growth factor receptor	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the protein kinase superfamily. This protein is a receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a cell surface protein that binds to epidermal growth factor. Binding of the protein to a ligand induces receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation and leads to cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene are associated with lung cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2016].
13	TP53	7157	{BCC7," LFS1"," P53"," TRP53"}	tumor protein p53	protein-coding	This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277). [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016].
14	CDKN1A	1026	{CAP20," CDKN1"," CIP1"," MDA-6"," P21"," SDI1"," WAF1"," p21CIP1"}	cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A	protein-coding	This gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase2 or -cyclin-dependent kinase4 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. The expression of this gene is tightly controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, through which this protein mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. This protein can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair. This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by CASP3-like caspases, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of cyclin-dependent kinase2, and may be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis following caspase activation. Mice that lack this gene have the ability to regenerate damaged or missing tissue. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015].
15	MKI67	4288	{KIA," MIB-"," MIB-1"," PPP1R105"}	marker of proliferation Ki-67	protein-coding	This gene encodes a nuclear protein that is associated with and may be necessary for cellular proliferation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. A related pseudogene exists on chromosome X. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009].
16	BCL2	596	{Bcl-2," PPP1R50"}	BCL2, apoptosis regulator	protein-coding	This gene encodes an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks the apoptotic death of some cells such as lymphocytes. Constitutive expression of BCL2, such as in the case of translocation of BCL2 to Ig heavy chain locus, is thought to be the cause of follicular lymphoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016].
17	BAX	581	{BCL2L4}	BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the BCL2 protein family. BCL2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. This protein forms a heterodimer with BCL2, and functions as an apoptotic activator. This protein is reported to interact with, and increase the opening of, the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which leads to the loss in membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. The expression of this gene is regulated by the tumor suppressor P53 and has been shown to be involved in P53-mediated apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode different isoforms, have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
18	HDAC1	3065	{GON-10," HD1"," RPD3"," RPD3L1"}	histone deacetylase 1	protein-coding	Histone acetylation and deacetylation, catalyzed by multisubunit complexes, play a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family and is a component of the histone deacetylase complex. It also interacts with retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein and this complex is a key element in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Together with metastasis-associated protein-2, it deacetylates p53 and modulates its effect on cell growth and apoptosis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
19	GRM4	2914	{GPRC1D," MGLUR4"," mGlu4"}	glutamate metabotropic receptor 4	protein-coding	L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, that have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group I includes GRM1 and GRM5 and these receptors have been shown to activate phospholipase C. Group II includes GRM2 and GRM3 while Group III includes GRM4, GRM6, GRM7 and GRM8.

It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar. The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres. HPE is manifested by facial deformities. It is also thought that mutations in this gene or in its signalling pathway may be responsible for VACTERL syndrome, which is characterized by vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, cardiac anomalies, and limb abnormalities.

The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. Some of the targets of the encoded miRNA are the transcripts for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, interleukin 1-beta, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, and complement factor H. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015].

The encoded protein may inhibit chemotaxis and invasion and thereby attenuate metastasis in malignant melanomas. Studies suggest a putative role in the regulation of events downstream of cell-matrix adhesion, perhaps involving cytoskeletal reorganization. A protein product of this gene, kisspeptin, stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced gonadotropin secretion and regulates the pubertal activation of GnRH nuerons. A polymorphism in the terminal exon of this mRNA results in two protein isoforms. An adenosine present at the polymorphic site represents the third position in a stop codon. When the adenosine is absent, a downstream stop codon is utilized and the encoded protein extends for an additional seven amino acid residues. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012].

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily. Members of the MDR/TAP subfamily are involved in multidrug resistance. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds with broad substrate specificity. It is responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells and often mediates the development of resistance to anticancer drugs. This protein also functions as a transporter in the blood-brain barrier. Mutations in this gene are associated with colchicine resistance and Inflammatory bowel disease 13.

It maps to a region on chromosome 1p36 that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors, and thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes. The demonstration that this gene is monoallelically expressed (likely from the maternal allele), supports the notion that it is a candidate gene for neuroblastoma. Many transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing and/or use of alternate promoters have been found for this gene, but the biological validity and the full-length nature of some variants have not been determined.

158	FADD	8772	{GIG3," MORT1"}	Fas associated via death domain	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is an adaptor molecule that interacts with various cell surface receptors and mediates cell apoptotic signals. Through its C-terminal death domain, this protein can be recruited by TNFRSF6/Fas-receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor, TNFRSF25, and TNFSF10/TRAIL-receptor, and thus it participates in the death signaling initiated by these receptors. Interaction of this protein with the receptors unmasks the N-terminal effector domain of this protein, which allows it to recruit caspase-8, and thereby activate the cysteine protease cascade. Knockout studies in mice also suggest the importance of this protein in early T cell development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate A and B polypeptide chains. These chains associate via a single disulfide bond to form the catalytically inactive high molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (HMW-uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into the catalytically active low molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (LMW-uPA). This low molecular weight form does not bind to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Quebec platelet disorder and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].

Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group D2. This protein is monoubiquinated in response to DNA damage, resulting in its localization to nuclear foci with other proteins (BRCA1 AND BRCA2) involved in homology-directed DNA repair.

The 105 kD protein is a Rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor and the 50 kD protein is a DNA binding subunit of the NF-kappa-B (NFKB) protein complex. NFKB is a transcription regulator that is activated by various intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Activated NFKB translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological functions. Inappropriate activation of NFKB has been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases while persistent inhibition of NFKB leads to inappropriate immune cell development or delayed cell growth.

Importin-alpha binds the NLS, while importin-beta mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex. After translocation, RanGTP binds importin-beta and displaces importin-alpha. Importin-alpha must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. The protein encoded by this gene binds strongly to NLS-free importin-alpha, and this binding is released in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RANBP1 and RANGAP1.

This protein is activated by, and mediates the responses of many cell ligands, such as IL2, IL3, IL7 GM-CSF, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and different growth hormones. Activation of this protein in myeloma and lymphoma associated with a TEL/JAK2 gene fusion is independent of cell stimulus and has been shown to be essential for tumorigenesis. The mouse counterpart of this gene is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which suggests the antiapoptotic function of this gene in cells.

This gene functionally complements Chinese hamster irs1SF, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to a number of different DNA-damaging agents and is chromosomally unstable. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity.

The action of this enzyme includes lyase activity for chain cleavage. Alternative splicing of the C-terminal region of this gene classifies splice variants into two major groups, type 1 and type 2, depending on the last exon of the sequence. Type 1 alternative splice variants end with exon 7 and type 2 end with exon 8. All variants share the N-terminal region in common, which contains a mitochondrial targeting signal that is essential for mitochondrial localization. Many alternative splice variants for this gene have been described, but the full-length nature for every variant has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008].
245	HDGF	3068	{HMG1L2}	heparin binding growth factor	protein-coding	This gene encodes a member of the hepatoma-derived growth factor family. The encoded protein has mitogenic and DNA-binding activity and may play a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. High levels of expression of this gene enhance the growth of many tumors. This gene was thought initially to be located on chromosome X; however, that location has been determined to correspond to a related pseudogene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].

The encoded protein associates with several multisubunit transcriptional complexes and with protein complexes involved in both ATP-dependent remodeling and histone modification. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].
248	CD34	947	{""}	CD34 molecule	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene may play a role in the attachment of stem cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix or to stromal cells.

PTPs are signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP is a large intracellular protein. It has a catalytic PTP domain at its C-terminus and two major structural domains: a region with five PDZ domains and a FERM domain that binds to plasma membrane and cytoskeletal elements. This PTP was found to interact with, and dephosphorylate, Fas receptor and IkappaBalpha through the PDZ domains. This suggests it has a role in Fas mediated programmed cell death. This PTP was also shown to interact with GTPase-activating protein, and thus may function as a regulator of Rho signaling pathways. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008].
250	PTEN	5728	{10q23del," BZS"," CWS1"," DEC"," GLM2"," MHAM"," MMAC1"," PTEN1"," PTENbeta"," TEP1"}	phosphatase and tensin homolog	protein-coding	This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine, and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 9. Alternative splicing and the use of multiple translation start codons results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015].

MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014].

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in the inhibition of casein kinase and altered expression of this protein is associated with the disease cystic fibrosis. This antimicrobial protein exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014].
253	GHR	2690	{GHBP," GHIP"}	growth hormone receptor	protein-coding	This gene encodes a member of the type I cytokine receptor family, which is a transmembrane receptor for growth hormone. Binding of growth hormone to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and the activation of an intra- and intercellular signal transduction pathway leading to growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Laron syndrome, also known as the growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS), a disorder characterized by short stature. In humans and rabbits, but not rodents, growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular ligand-binding domain from the mature growth hormone receptor protein. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].

370	Chemoradiation effect	Treatment response	No change/Progressive disease	No	No change/Progressive disease	Complete response/Partial response	\N	A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all measurable, assessable, and secondary lesions and no appearance of new lesions for at least 4 weeks. A partial response (PR) was defined as a decrease of -->50% in the size of two-dimensionally measurable lesions, a decrease of ->30% in the size of one-dimensionally measurable lesions, no progression of assessable lesions or secondary lesions due to tumor, and no appearance of new lesions. All these conditions had to last for at least 4 weeks. No change (NC) was defined as neither a 50% decrease in the size of two-dimensionally measurable lesions nor a 30% decrease in the size of one-dimensionally measurable lesions for 4 weeks. The rate of increase of any lesion was maintained within 25%. In addition, there could be no progression of secondary lesions due to tumor and no appearance of new lesions for at least 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a ->25% increase in the size of measurable lesions or the progression of other lesions and the appearance of new lesions.

A partial response (PR) was identified when the tumor mass shrunk ≥50%. Stable disease (SD) was identified when the tumor mass shrunk <50%, or when the tumor mass increase was ≤25%. Progressive disease (PD) was identified when one or more mass increased by ≥25%, or following the appearance of a new mass.
543	Response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy	Treatment response	No response	No	No response	Complete response/Partial response	\N	Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all measurable lesions within 2 months after treatment completion that lasted for at least 2 months after response documentation. A remnant scar on computed tomography scan measuring <5% of the initial tumor volume and with no signs of progression within 2 months after response documentation was considered as complete response. Similarly, partial and minimal response refers to a 50–95% and 25–49% reduction in tumor size, respectively. Small reductions in tumor size (0–24%) were considered stable disease. All other cases were considered progressive disease. In the present study, minimal response, stable, and progressive disease were considered in one group of no response..

To simplify statistical analysis, however, these were reduced to three groups: negative (none or < 10%), medium positive (10-50%) or high positive (> 50%).	Preoperative chemoradiation was offered to all patients after explaining the goals and risks of neoadjuvant vs a more selective adjuvant treatment. Thirty-three patients (group I) preferred to undergo immediate surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiation when indicated, while 34 (group II) accepted preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Eventually all patients were operated on undergoing a curative total mesorectal excision. Patients in group II were operated on 6-9 weeks after the completion of treatment. Patients in group I with positive lymph nodes received adjuvant chemoradiation. Preoperative chemoradiation therapy fields included the primary tumour, the adjacent lymph node drainage area in the pelvis and the regional nodes along the superior haemorrhoidal vessels. The tumour dose was 45 Gy delivered in 25 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy. Chemotherapy consisted of fluorouracil (5-FU, 375 mg/㎡ bolus daily for 5 days) and leucovorin (LV, 10 mg/㎡ daily for 5 days).

For the evaluation of immunoreactivity of CD44 in stroma, we defined the high expression group as cases that its strong expressions were localized in cancer stroma surrounding cancer nests.	Patients with rectal cancer were treated with short-course (a dose of 20 Gy in 4 fractions) or long-course (a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions) radiotherapy using a 4-field box technique with concurrent chemotherapy to take advantage of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) radio- sensitization. Patients underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy (intravenous infusion of 5-FU: 600 mg/㎡ for 24 h, and tegafur-uracil (UFT) given as 400 mg/㎡ orally for 5 days. This regimen was based on the previously tested combination of continuous infusion of 5-FU and oral administration of UFT. Short-course radiotherapy in our institute is different from standard short-course radiotherapy, 25 Gy in 5 fractions. There are several reasons that we designed the present regimen. We calculated a biologically equivalent dose (BED) of 20 Gy in 4 fractions using a linear quadratic model (25) and its BED was 30 Gy (α/β ratio: 10 Gy). We understand that BED: 30 Gy had a sufficient efficacy reducing the local failure of radiotherapy (26). Forty-two patients received short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy over 1 week. The remaining 10 patients received long-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 4 weeks. The time interval between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery was 2-3 weeks in short-course irradiation patients, and 4-6 weeks in long-course irradiation patients.

Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. Patients received posttumorectomy radiotherapy with a median dose of 51 Gy (range, 45 to 54 Gy) to the breast. A boost to the tumor bed was performed for 40 (75%) of patients with a median dose of 16 Gy (range, 7 to 25 Gy). The median total dose to the tumor bed was 66 Gy (range, 50 to 75 Gy). Supraclavicular irradiation was performed in 27 (51%) of patients. Internal mammary irradiation was performed in 38 (72%) of patients. In the case of lymph node involvement, the internal mammary chain and the supraclavicular area were both irradiated. In the absence of lymph node involvement, irradiation of the internal mammary chain, with or without the supraclavicular area, was indicated for centrally located tumors with histopathologic features of aggressiveness. Axillary irradiation was added in the presence of extensive axillary involvement or in the absence of axillary lymph node dissection. No protocol to boost all young patients with negative surgical margins was available at that time, and some patients reported in this series were accrued in the EORTC boost trial that randomized between boost and no boost from 1989 to 1996.

Briefly, the patients received three cycles of chemotherapy given concomitantly during Weeks 1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens involved combinations of cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cisplatin was given as a daily bolus dose of 100 mg/㎡, and 5-FU was administered as a 24-h continuous infusion at 1000 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days. Radiotherapy was delivered by a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation using a remote afterloading system incorporating an iridium-192 source (Gamma-Med II). External whole-pelvis irradiation was performed with at 1.8 Gy per fraction five times per week to a midline dose of 27.0-36.0 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation with six insertions (twice per week) with a fractional dose of 5.0 Gy to a total dose of 30.0 Gy at point A. The patients then received a second course of external irradiation with central shielding up to a total external dose of 45.0-50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5

For the three antibodies, the tumours were divided into two categories: group I (negative/weak) and group II (moderate/strong).	All patients received the same accelerated radiotherapy schedule using a concomitant boost technique. The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy, delivered in 41 fractions over a period of 38 days. The basic course was given to a total dose of 50.4 Gy over 5.5 weeks. The boost to sites of initial macroscopic tumour involvement consisted of a dose of 19.5 Gy and was given as a second daily fraction, starting the last day of the second week of the basic treatment. According to our institutional policy, 14 (12%) patients underwent a planned neck dissection before radiotherapy; either radical or modified radical, whereas in one patient, the involved lymph node was excised. 3	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5

Cytoplasmic BIRC2 distribution was scored as 0 for no staining, 1+ for a light and foamy staining pattern, and 2+ for a heavy and diffuse staining pattern.	Briefly, the external radiation was delivered with 10-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator at a total dose of 50 Gy to whole pelvis through anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior portals. A daily dose of 2 Gy was given 5 days weekly. Parametrial boosts using simple rectangular midline shielding blocks (4-cm wide at the midplane) were individualized according to stage to avoid over- dosage to the bladder and rectum. For stage I patients, a central shielding was used during the entire course of irradiation. A central shielding was set after 20 Gy for stage II patients and after 30 Gy for stage III and IV patients. For intracavitary irradiation, HDR brachytherapy using the remote after-loading system was performed. Patients were treated once weekly with a dose of 6 Gy to point A. Stage I patients typically received five sessions of HDR brachy- therapy to a total dose of 30 Gy. For stage II patients, a central shield was placed after 20 Gy so that from the third week onward, patients had four HDR brachytherapy sessions once weekly to a total brachytherapy dose of 24 Gy. For stage III and IV patients, a central shield was placed after 30 Gy, so that patients underwent three HDR brachytherapy sessions from the fourth week and the dose delivered was 18 Gy.

Percentages of positive staining above the cutoff level were considered as high expression and those below as low expression.	All patients in this cohort primarily were treated with exclusively radiotherapy, using 6MV linear accelerator equipment. In patients with T1 to T2aN0 LSCC, clinical target volume consisted of the gross tumor volume with a 1-cm margin. Direct simulation was achieved using the inferior border of the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage as field borders. In this group of patients, two opposing lateral fields were used, with a median fraction dose of 2.0 Gy (5 fractions/week) up to 66 to 70 Gy in 7 weeks. In the remaining T2 LSCC patients or in case of lymph node metastasis, the initial clinical target volume consisted of the primary tumor, the pathological lymph nodes with a 1-cm margin, and bilateral elective nodal areas. For both the boost volume, consisting of the primary tumor and the pathological lymph nodes, as well as for the planning target volume, a margin of 0.5 cm was used. Two opposing lateral fields were used for the site of the primary tumor and the lymph nodes located in the upper neck levels. An anterior field for the lower neck levels only was added in the case of anatomical variations. A total dose of 46 Gy was delivered to the initial planning target volume; then, a boost dose of 24 Gy was delivered to the primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes (70 Gy in total).	Radiotherapy	5

The staining extent was scored on a 0 to 4 scale, where 0 = no staining, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, and 4 = 76% to 100%. The IRS, which ranged from 0 to 7, was obtained by adding the 2 parameters. To examine the prognostic importance of EGFR expression for survival between patients with negative to moderate expression levels and those with high expression levels, the cutoff level for EGFR expression was deﬁned by a dichotomous variable, low expression (IRS 0 to 5) or high expression (IRS 6 to 7).	Radiation was delivered with 6-MV and 10-MV photons, by use of a 3-ﬁeld technique (posterior and both laterals) in most patients. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days per week, once per day, at 1.8 Gy per day. The pelvic radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, which was followed by a boost dose of 5.4 Gy, administered in 3 fractions to the primary tumor by 2 lateral ﬁelds. Preoperative chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiation therapy and consisted of 2 cycles of i.v. bolus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡/day) for 5 days each. Each cycle of chemotherapy was administered concurrently in an outpatient setting on the 1st and 5th weeks of pelvic preoperative radiotherapy. Approximately 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, the patients underwent definitive surgery. The surgical management included a sphincter preservation approach whenever possible, by use of the totalmesorectal excision technique.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5

If the distributions of immunoreactivity were ≥50%, then they were classified as the overexpression groups.	Briefly, the patients received three cycles of chemotherapy given concomitantly during Week 1, Week 4, and Week 7 of radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cisplatin was given as a daily bolus dose of 100 mg/㎡, and 5-FU was administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion at a dose of 1000 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days. Radiotherapy was delivered with a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation by a remote afterloading system using iridium 192 sources (Gamma-Med II). External whole pelvis irradiation was performed with a dose of 1.8 grays (Gy) per fraction 5 times per week to a midline dose of 27.0-36.0 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation with 6 insertions (twice per week) with a fractional dose of 5.0 Gy to a total dose of 30.0 Gy at point A.

The percentage of stained infiltrating tumour cells (0%, <1%, 1-5%, 6-25%, 26-50%, >50%) and the intensity of the staining (weak, moderate and strong) were recorded. The final score was determined by combining these 2 parameters: (0) no detectable expression, or expression in less than 5% of the cells whatever the intensity, or in less than 25% of the cells with a weak intensity; (1) weak labelling in more than 25% of cells; (2) moderate or strong labelling in more than 6% of the cells. TP53 immunostaining was evaluated by means of DO7 antibody and classified as strong  (>50% of labelled tumour cells), weak (<50% and >5% of labelled tumour cells) or low (<5% of labelled tumour cells). The proliferative index could be evaluated by means of MIB1 antibody in 326 cases. The result was expressed according to the percentage of labelled tumour cells (>10%, between 5 and 10% or , <5%) and was further classified as high (>10% of labelled tumour cells) or low (<10% of labelled tumour cells).

Intensity of PTGS2 staining was graded on a scale of 0 to 3+, with 0 representing no detectable stain and 3+ representing the strongest stain (1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong). The raw data were converted to the IHS by adding the quantity and intensity staining scores. Theoretically, the scores could range from 0 to 6. Because of limited case numbers, we modified the Soslow staging system so as to allocate patients to two groups instead of four. An IHS score of 3 to 6 was considered as high expression and 0 to 2 (0 + 0 or 1 + 1) as low (or no) expression.	All received potentially curative doses of radiation (range, 5880-8160 cGy; mean dose, 7252 cGy) using similar methods. The nasopharyngeal tumor, local extension sites, and entire neck lymphatics were irradiated with 6-MV x-ray to a total dose of 4680 cGy/26 fractions by means of bilateral opposing and separate single anterior low-neck fields, followed by a boost to the primary tumor to the desired total dose. The posterior neck lymph nodes were boosted by electrons to the desired dose according to the lymph node status of the patient. One patient did not complete the radiation treatment, and only 5880 cGy was delivered to the tumor. Another patient was entered into a hyperfractionated protocol and received a radiation dose of 8160 cGy (120 cGy twice daily treatment) to the nasopharynx. The other 35 patients received a homogeneous radiation dose ranging from 7020 to 7480 cGy. Only five patients received adjuvant chemotherapy.

The standard loading was 20-mg, 20-mg, and 10-mg RaEq sources in tandem and two 20-mg RaEq sources in the vaginal ovoid of 3 cm interdistance. The ﬁrst insertion was carried out after external pelvis irradiation with 20-30 Gy. The second insertion was performed 7-10 days later, and ﬁnal insertion was performed at the completion of external beam irradiation. The dose rate at point A was 0.9-1.2 Gy per hour. The total doses of brachytherapy at point A ranged from 50.4 to 60.9 Gy, with a median dose of 55.6 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5

Surgery consisted of a transoral excision in 24 cases (14%) with early-stage tumors, combined with a discontinuous neck dissection in 17 cases (10%). In 141 cases (86%) surgery consisted of more extensive procedures, i.e., commando-resection including partial or total glossectomy and neck dissection. Surgery was performed in the VU University Medical Center in all cases. Radiotherapy was delivered using megavoltage equipment (6-MV linear accelerator). The target volume of the initial ﬁeld encompassed the primary site plus a 2-cm margin and the entire surgical bed. In case of N , the neck nodes on both sides were included in the initial target volume as well. Generally, the initia target volume was irradiated using two opposing lateral ﬁelds. The initial ﬁeld was irradiated with a fraction dose of 2 Gy (5 times a week/once a day) to the central axis up to a total dose of 46 to 50 Gy. In case the total dose was 50 Gy, the spinal cord was shielded after 40 Gy and the anterior part of the neck was irradiated with a dose per fraction of 2 Gy up to 50 Gy using photons, whereas the posterior neck triangle was irradiated using electrons (6 to 12 MeV) with a dose per fraction of 3 Gy up to a total dose of 49 Gy. The dose of the electrons was speciﬁed at the 100% isodose level, and the energy of the electrons was determined in such a way that the maximum dose to the spinal cord was 20% or less. In case of negative surgical margins, the primary site with a 1-cm margin was boosted, using a dose per fraction of 2.5 Gy (5 times a week) up to a median total dose of 55 Gy. In case of positive or close surgical margins, the median total dose to the primary site with a 1-cm margin was 62.5 Gy. In case of lymph node metastases with extranodal spread, the median total dose to these regions was 62.5 Gy. In most cases, the booster ﬁeld was irradiated using a shrinking ﬁeld technique. Sixty-four patients (39%) started postoperative radiotherapy on Monday and ﬁnished their treatment on Friday with an overall treatment time (OTTRT) of less than 6 weeks.

Strong and moderate staining groups were deﬁned as positive for EGFR expression. VEGFA staining was graded as follows: (a) +, staining intensity in cancer cells was stronger than that in stromal cells; (b) ±, staining intensity in cancer cells was equal to that in stromal cells; and (c) -, staining intensity in cancer cells was weaker than that in stromal cells. The cases graded as + were deﬁned as positive. The percentages of CCND1-positive tumor cells were calculated by counting the number of brownstained tumor nuclei/total number of cancer cells in the most highly stained area on a high-power view (x400). Cut-off values were determined by the following estimation: CCND1-positive judgment was a more than 30% labeling index. PCNA was calculated as the percentage of PCNA-positive cancer cells by counting more than 1000 cancer cells in more than three ﬁelds of a specimen with x400 magniﬁcation microscopy without knowing any clinical information. For the endoscopic biopsy specimens, PCNA were counted at the site of the maximum number of positive nuclei in the whole tumor. Only strong nuclear staining was regarded as positive, and weak nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was regarded as negative. The PCNA index was the percentage of nuclei staining positive. A PCNA score greater than 40 was taken as PCNA-positive. Also, tumors in which positive nuclei were observed in 20% or more cells were considered to be overexpressing TP53. 	Chemotherapy consisted of the protracted infusion of 5-FU 400 mg/㎡ /day on days 1–5 and 8–12 combined with CDDP 40 mg/㎡ with adequate hydration and antiemetic coverage on days 1 and 8. This schedule was repeated twice every 5 weeks. Radiation therapy using megavoltage X-rays was started on day 1 concomitantly with chemotherapy. The planned target volume for carcinoma of the upper or middle third esophagus included the primary tumor with a 3 cm margin craniocaudally, metastatic nodes with a 1–1.5 cm margin, supraclavicular fossa and mediastinum. For carcinoma of the lower third esophagus, the ﬁeld was extended to include the perigastric nodes, and the supraclavicular fossa was excluded if the cervical nodes tested negative. When the planned volume included both the supraclavicular fossa and upper abdominal nodes, a daily dose of 2.0 Gy was allowed. A 2-week interval took place after a dose of 30 Gy. Radiation therapy was restarted on day 36 along with the same schedule of chemotherapy as before. The irradiation techniques used were anterior- and posterior-opposed equally weighted beams up to a dose of 40 Gy. Then, the radiation portals were changed to shield the spinal cord and to craniocaudally encompass the primary tumor with a 2–3 cm margin. Metastatic nodes were encompassed with a 1–1.5 cm margin. The radiation dose to the spinal cord was kept at a maximum of 50 Gy. The homogeneity of the dose within the planned target volume was within ±10% of the prescribed dose. For patients treated with prophylactic ﬁlgrastim, a daily dose of 75 mg/total body was administered subcutaneously during the period between days 18 and 31. The treatment was discontinued when disease progression, patient refusal or delay of recovery from the toxicity in excess of 6 weeks from the initiation of the treatment occurred.

In brief, all patients underwent combination therapy with external beam irradiation of the entire pelvis and four sessions of high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Overall treatment time from initiation of irradiation to completion did not exceed 7 weeks. The external irradiation was administered with a linear accelerator using a 10-MV photon beam using anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel opposite ports. Fractionation was a 1.8-Gy dose to the tumor daily, 5 fractions per week. A midline shield 3 cm wide at the central axis was inserted when the total dose reached 30.6 Gy. Irradiation was subsequently continued up to a total irradiation dose of 50.6 Gy with a dose of 2 Gy per fraction, 5 times per week. Brachytherapy was delivered with iridium-192 sources by a remote afterloading system. The first insertion was carried out after the midline shielding; the following 3 fractions were administered once per week with a fraction dose of 5 to 7 Gy at Point A. The total brachytherapy dose ranged from 23 to 28 Gy. Weekly chemotherapy consisting of 40 mg/㎡ of cisplatin was given concurrently with RT (radiotherapy) for 25 (53%) of the 47 patients in this study. In principle, chemotherapy was administered for patients with bulky tumors (tumor length >4 cm) or Stage III to IV disease, but RT alone was performed for patients with advanced disease who were considered unsuitable for concomitant chemotherapy after age and renal function were taken into consideration. With regard to use of anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, a non-COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was routinely administered immediately before each session of brachytherapy. Furthermore, 13 patients (28%) received non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs such as loxoprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen for relief of pain or inflammation during the course of RT treatment. All biopsy specimens were excised from the surface of non-necrotic cervical tumors before and 1 week after initiation of RT (a total dose of 9 Gy with or without a course of chemotherapy). All tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and subjected to a TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemical staining for COX-2.

Strong and moderate staining groups were defined as positive for EGFR expression For the evaluation of VEGFA expression, when intensive positive staining of VEGFA was observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells, the case was considered VEGFA-positive. For PTGS2, the intensity of staining was determined as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). A combined score based on the staining intensity and the percentage of stained cells was used as the final score. Low expression was defined as an intensity of 2 or 3 and < 10% stained cells or an intensity of 0 or 1 and < 50% stained cells. High expression was defined as an intensity of 2 or 3 and > 10% stained cells or intensity 1 and > 50% stained cells.	Radiotherapy was performed using a LINAC 6- or 10-MV X-ray unit, in daily 1.8 or 2 Gy with five fractions per week. The radiation dose ranged from 40 to 68.4 Gy with a median of 54 Gy. Initially anteroposterior and posteroanterior fields were used with a craniocaudal margin of 5 cm and a transverse margin of 2 cm adjacent to the gross tumor mass as determined by chest CT or esophagography. At doses between 36 and 40 Gy, a chest CT was performed for 3D-conformal radiotherapy planning and a boost dose was delivered to clinical target volumes with a craniocaudal margin of 3 cm and a transverse margin of 2 cm adjacent to the gross tumor volumes. Further radiotherapy boosts were administered to cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes depending on nodal size. To patients with adequate bone marrow function, as well as hepatic, and renal function, concurrent chemotherapy was delivered with 5-fluorouracil based regimen. Cisplatinum (75 mg/㎡) was administered intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13, and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/㎡) was administered as a continuous infusion for the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13; the first two cycles were delivered concurrently with radiotherapy. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) received cisplatinum + 5-fluorouracil with a median of three cycles (range 1-10) and 13 patients received cispatinum plus TS-1 of oral fluorouracil agent.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was administered with megavoltage equipment of photon energies of 4 MeV or more. The total doses of EBRT ranged from 40 to 66.6 Gy with a single fraction of 1.8-2 Gy administered 5 days per week. The median total dose of all 25 patients was 66.6 Gy, and 22 of 25 patients (88.0%) were treated with a total doses of 60 Gy or more. The treatment field of EBRT consisted of localized field in 4 patients (16%), and the primary tumor plus regional lymph nodes in the remaining 21 patients (84%). In most patients, computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning and conformal radiotherapy were used. Anterior-posterior opposed fields were used up to 32.4-40 Gy, and a booster dose of 14-34.2 Gy was given, using bilateral oblique or multiple fields. The clinical target volume for the primary tumor was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 3 cm craniocaudally. The planning target volumes for the primary tumor and the metastatic lymph nodes were determined with 1- to 1.5-cm margins to compensate for setup variations and internal organ motion. Lung heterogeneity corrections were not used. Chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy. One course of chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (80 mg/㎡ on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/㎡ on days 2-6), with 3-4 week intervals to a total of 1-2 courses.

Strong and moderate staining groups were defined as positive for EGFR expression, in agreement with previous interpretations of EGFR in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. VEGFA staining was graded as follows: (a) +, staining intensity in cancer cells was stronger than that in stromal cells; (b) ±, staining intensity in cancer cells was equal to that in stromal cells; and (c) -, staining intensity in cancer cells was weaker than that in stromal cells. The cases graded as + were defined as positive, as described in previous reports.  The percentages of CCND1-positive tumor cells were calculated by counting the number of brown-stained tumor nuclei/total number of cancer cells in the most highly stained area on a high-power view (x400). Cut-off values were determined by the following estimation: CCND1-positive judgment was a more than 30% labeling index.  The PCNA index was the percentage of nuclei staining positive. A PCNA score greater than 40 was taken as PCNA-positive.	The treatment comprised protracted 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion (400 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 and 8-12), and a 2 h infusion of cisplatinum (CDDP 40 mg/㎡on days 1 and 8) combined with radiation therapy (2 Gy/day) delivered for 3 weeks (5 days/week). These schedules were repeated twice every 4-5 weeks and the total radiation dose was 60 Gy. For patients who showed an objective response to treatment, additional chemotherapy was administered and consisted of a protracted infusion of 5-FU (800 mg/㎡/day) on days 1-5 and a 2 h infusion of CDDP (80 mg/㎡/day) on day 1. This treatment was repeated every 4 weeks for two courses. No further treatment was administered if no disease progression was observed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5

The intensity of NFKB1 nuclear staining was evaluated on a three-point semiquantitative scale as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak to moderate; 2, strong staining. The extent of cancer cells with positive NFKB1 was expressed as the fraction of labeled cells (i.e., staining levels 1 and 2) in the cancer fields. Cases showing labeling index of ≥5% were regarded as positive for the purpose of the analysis.	Induction chemotherapy was administered to 53 patients. Of these, 42 were enrolled in a clinical trial combining docetaxel, irinotecan, and 5-fluorouracil, 8 patients were treated in a platinol-based induction therapy trial, and 3 patients were treated with a taxane-based combination. If there was no cancer progression observed, patients received a second cycle of induction chemotherapy. Patients received up to 50.4 Gy of radiotherapy in 28 fractions. The baseline chemotherapy for all patients was 5-fluorouracil but all patients received additional drugs; most commonly, a platinol, taxane, or camptothecin. Concurrent chemotherapy combination was given for 5 weeks (Monday-Friday) of the first 5 radiation weeks. Five to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, a complete restaging was done.

The IRS value was determined by considering the intensity, graded on a scale of 0-3 (0 = no staining, 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining, and 3 = strong staining) and extent (percentage of positive tumor cells) of staining. The extent of staining was graded on a scale of 0-4 (0 = no staining; 1 = 1-25% staining, 2 = 26-50% staining, 3 = 51-75% staining, and 4 = 76-100% staining). An IRS value (range, 0-7) was obtained by adding the two parameters. The cutoff level of expression of the biochemical markers was deﬁned as a dichotomous variable of low expression (IRS value 0-5) or high (IRS 6-7) in p53, p21, MIB-1, and Bcl-2; low (0-4) or high (5-7) in EGFR; and low (0-3) or high (4-7) in HER2, respectively.	Patients were treated with a combination of conventional pelvic external beam cCRT (concurrent chemoradiation therapy) and high-dose-rate intracavitary cCRT. The details of the treatment protocol have been previously reported. External beam cCRT energy was 10 MV. A four-ﬁeld irradiation technique was used to spare the small intestine. Treatment position was supine. Simulation was by computed tomography (CT) simulator. The standard treatment protocol of our institution consists of the following: whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) of 19.8 Gy in 11 fractions (Fr) plus WPRT with a midline block (MB) of 30.6 Gy in 17 Fr for all Stage IIA and Stage IIB without a bulky mass ($4cm); WPRT of 30.6 Gy in 17 Fr plus WPRT with MB of 19.8 Gy in 11 Fr for Stage IIB with a bulky mass all Stage IIIA and Stage IIIB without a bulky mass; and WPRT of 39.6 Gy in 18 Fr plus WPRT with MB of 10.8 Gy in 6 Fr for Stage IIIB with a bulky mass and Stage IVA. Patients treated postoperatively were excluded. In addition to central shielding cCRT, these patients also underwent intracavitary cCRT. Theintracavitary cCRT was performed with Ir-192 sources with four insertions (one or two weekly), at fraction doses of 6.0 Gy at Point A. Concurrent chemotherapy was combined with cCRT in all patients. All patients received cisplatinalone (75 mg/㎡ in a bolus infusion on Days 1, 22, and 43).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5

Expression was determined by assessing semiquantitatively the percentage of decorated tumor cells and the staining intensity. The percentage of positive cells was rated as follows: 1-10% positive cells (1+), 11-50% positive (2+); 51-80% positive (3+); and, >80% positive cells (4+). Staining intensity was scored as weak (1+), moderate (2+), and intensive (3+).

This receptor contains a death domain. It has been shown to play a central role in the physiological regulation of programmed cell death, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases of the immune system. The interaction of this receptor with its ligand allows the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex that includes Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), caspase 8, and caspase 10. The autoproteolytic processing of the caspases in the complex triggers a downstream caspase cascade, and leads to apoptosis. This receptor has been also shown to activate NF-kappaB, MAPK3/ERK1, and MAPK8/JNK, and is found to be involved in transducing the proliferating signals in normal diploid fibroblast and T cells.

This FAD-binding protein forms homodimers and reduces quinones to hydroquinones. This protein's enzymatic activity prevents the one electron reduction of quinones that results in the production of radical species.

Mutations in this gene are associated with Cockayne syndrome type B and cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome 1. Alternative splicing occurs between a splice site from exon 5 of this gene to the 3' splice site upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) of the adjacent gene, piggyback-derived-3 (GeneID:267004), which activates the alternative polyadenylation site downstream of the piggyback-derived-3 ORF.

Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with CDK7 kinase and ring finger protein MAT1. The kinase complex is able to phosphorylate CDK2 and CDC2 kinases, thus functions as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). This cyclin and its kinase partner are components of TFIIH, as well as RNA polymerase II protein complexes. They participate in two different transcriptional regulation processes, suggesting an important link between basal transcription control and the cell cycle machinery. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 4. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010].

In E. coli, the MutS protein helps in the recognition of mismatched nucleotides prior to their repair. A highly conserved region of approximately 150 aa, called the Walker-A adenine nucleotide binding motif, exists in MutS homologs. The encoded protein heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form a mismatch recognition complex that functions as a bidirectional molecular switch that exchanges ADP and ATP as DNA mismatches are bound and dissociated.

This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to metabolize as many as 25% of commonly prescribed drugs. Its substrates include antidepressants, antipsychotics, analgesics and antitussives, beta adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrythmics and antiemetics. The gene is highly polymorphic in the human population; certain alleles result in the poor metabolizer phenotype, characterized by a decreased ability to metabolize the enzyme's substrates. Some individuals with the poor metabolizer phenotype have no functional protein since they carry 2 null alleles whereas in other individuals the gene is absent. This gene can vary in copy number and individuals with the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype can have 3 or more active copies of the gene.

The encoded protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of this gene.

Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008].

At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2012].

Unlike most MMP family members, activation of this protein can occur on the cell membrane. This enzyme can be activated extracellularly by proteases, or, intracellulary by its S-glutathiolation with no requirement for proteolytical removal of the pro-domain. This protein is thought to be involved in multiple pathways including roles in the nervous system, endometrial menstrual breakdown, regulation of vascularization, and metastasis.

This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site.

Deregulation of telomerase expression in somatic cells may be involved in oncogenesis. Studies in mouse suggest that telomerase also participates in chromosomal repair, since de novo synthesis of telomere repeats may occur at double-stranded breaks.

The N-terminal FADD-like death effector domain of this protein suggests that it may interact with Fas-interacting protein FADD. This protein was detected in the insoluble fraction of the affected brain region from Huntington disease patients but not in those from normal controls, which implicated the role in neurodegenerative diseases. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described, although not all variants have had their full-length sequences determined.

The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. Some of the targets of the encoded miRNA are the transcripts for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, interleukin 1-beta, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, and complement factor H.

This protein is present at telomeres in metaphase of the cell cycle, is a second negative regulator of telomere length and plays a key role in the protective activity of telomeres. While having similar telomere binding activity and domain organization, TERF2 differs from TERF1 in that its N terminus is basic rather than acidic. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
222	CLOCK	9575	{KAT13D," bHLHe8"}	clock circadian regulator	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene plays a central role in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

Binding of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor alpha to the membrane-bound receptor induces receptor trimerization and activation, which plays a role in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammation. Proteolytic processing of the encoded receptor results in release of the soluble form of the receptor, which can interact with free tumor necrosis factor alpha to inhibit inflammation. Mutations in this gene underlie tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), characterized by fever, abdominal pain and other features. Mutations in this gene may also be associated with multiple sclerosis in human patients. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2016].

SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the TGF-beta receptors through its interaction with the SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

The daily dose at the isocenter was 1.8 Gy; the total dose to the entire pelvis was 45 Gy. For a sphincter-preservation approach, 29 patients with a very low rectal cancer, uT2 or uT3 on endorectal ultrasonography initial staging, and M0 by CT scan received a boost dose of 15 Gy. The boost volume covered the primary tumor plus a 1.5-cm margin using a three-ﬁeld (posterior and oblique) technique. The median time between the ﬁrst day of RT and surgery was 10   3.9 weeks. The choice of surgical procedure was at the surgeon’s discretion. A total proctectomy with complete excision of the mesorectum was systematically performed. For upper tumors of the lower third of the rectum, the rectal section was performed during the abdominal approach, close to the levator ani muscle, and then a per anum mucosectomy was made. For lower tumors, the distal pole of the specimen was dissected through the anus, immediately above the dentate line. For tumors located at or near the superior end of the sphincter ring, an intersphincteric resection was performed with partial or complete removal of the internal sphincter. Bowel continuity was restored by coloanal anastomosis, preferably with a J colonic pouch or directly for a narrow pelvis in obese men. Abdominoperineal resection was performed when the patients had a compromised sphincter function, when the tumor invaded the external anal sphincter or the levator ani muscle, or in case of a bulky tumor within a narrow pelvis. The operative specimen was staged according to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer pTNM staging system. All patients had a R0 resection with lateral margins  1 mm. Postoperative management of enrolled patients was performed according to French standards in use during the inclusion time. Speciﬁcally, patients with a posttherapeutic positive nodal status received an adjuvant regimen of ﬂuorouracil and leucovorin. Moreover, patients who developed local or distant recurrence were treated by various chemotherapy regimens or a second surgical resection.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5

Custom-expanded foam immobilization casts were used for the majority of patients; however, implanted prostatic fiducial markers were not employed at the time of this study. The clinical target volume (prostatic tissue containing biopsy-proven adencarcinoma or its suspected microscopic extensions) was typically considered to be the entire prostate gland ± bilateral seminal vesicles. Axial clinical target volume images underwent segmentation with digital delineation of clinical target volume, planning target volume (a 10-mm tangential expansion of the clinical target volume), rectum form anorectal junction to retosigmoid junction (as per the guidelines of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1994-2006 clinical trial; ref. 3), and entire bladder using the Helax TMS treatment planning system versions 5  to 6 (Nucletron Canada, Kanata, Ontario, Canada). The organ at risk (rectum, bladder, and proximal femoral bones) were delineated as "solid" organs. 3-DCRT was planned using beam's eye view techniques with either custom cerrobend of multileaf collimator shaped fileds using anterior, posterior, right, and left lateral 15 to 18 MV X-rays (Varian Medical Systems, Corona, CA). A few patiens received treatment with right and left anterior oblique fields in addition to the four fields descried above. The planning target volume received a mean dose of 77.1 Gy (range, 68.3-82.1Gy) in five daily fractions per week. The number of fractions ranged from 35 to 44, and in al patients, the planning target volume received a minimum dose per fraction of 1.8 to 2Gy. Pelvic lymph nodes were not treated by intention in any patient. Doses to "partial" volumes of the organs at risk and planning target volume were recorded form the dose-volume histograms at each "decile" of fractional volume (i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.) At the discretion of treating radiation oncologist, short-course (2-4 months pre 3-DCRT) neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (leuprolide depot, goserelin acetate, or burserelin ± flutamide) was given to 35 patients (42%).

The whole breast was treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy (40.05 Gy in 15 fractions) with 6-MV photons of an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator (Crawley, United Kingdom). An additional photon boost of 10 Gy in 4 fractions to the tumour bed was given to 75% of the patients. For the prone patient setup, a unilateral breast holder (Van De Velde, Schellebelle, Belgium) and a prone breast board (Orfit Industries) were used. Twenty-two patients were treated in prone position with voluntary moderate deep inspiration breath hold. At CMSE Namur, a sliding window tangential field-IMRT technique was used associated with moderate deep inspiration breath hold whenever the primary beam intersected the heart as previously described by Remouchamps et al. Patients with self-reported bra cup size ≥ D received normofractionated radiotherapy (50.00 Gy in 25 fractions), women with bra cup size < D received hypofractionation or normofractionation according to the preference of the radiation oncologist (n = 28). More than 90% received an additional boost of 10 Gy in 4 fractions with electron beams. Nodal irradiation was performed by a complex multi-beam IMRT or arc technique at GUH, at CMSE Namur, a one point setup with 4 beams with dynamic intensity modulation in the beams was used. Adjuvant hormone therapy, consisting of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, was administered in most patients concomitantly with IMRT. The others received hormone therapy sequentially after IMRT. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, combination of antracyclines and taxanes, completed chemotherapy before IMRT, while trastuzumab was allowed concomitantly with IMRT.

The planning target volume (PTV) dose prescription ranged from 40.05 Gy (55 patients), 45.00 Gy (1 patient), and 50.00 Gy (3 patients). In most cases, the PTV irradiation was followed by a boost phase of 10.00 Gy to the tumoral bed (47 patients). Conventional (200 cGy/day) and accelerated fractionations (250 or 267 cGy/day) were used. Computed tomography images were acquired with a ﬁxed step size of 5 mm. In accordance with the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU 50), the PTV was generated by expanding the clinical target volume, that is, the entire breast for approximately 5 mm from the body contour, of 7 mm in all directions but in the direction of the skin surface, to compensate for set-up uncertainty. In the skin direction, the distance between the body and PTV was left at 5–6 mm so as to not excessively penalize the dose–volume histogram calculations. Ninetyﬁve percent isodose included PTV so this dose was at 5 mm under the skin. All PTVs were contoured by the same radiation oncologist, and a single physicist individually performed all treatment plans. The linear accelerator used was a Varian 2100 (Varian Medical Systems), which has an enhanced dynamic wedge. The treatment planning system (Varian Eclipse version 7.3.10; Varian Medical Systems) used a calculation pencil beam algorithm with the modiﬁed Batho power law as tissue inhomogeneity correction method; the grid calculation dose was 2.5 mm for the dose calculation for all patients. The optimized plan had isocentric photon beams with 6 or 15 MV energy, and the beam separation angle was approximately 174° ± 5° as to align the beam’s internal divergence and to avoid involving the contralateral breast.

This fractionation schedule was applied both as an adjuvant, post-operative treatment and administered to women who had RT after a loco-regional recurrence following breast cancer surgery some years prior to referral to the NRH. This RT schedule was expected to be more effective and at the same time less resource-consuming than the conventional fractionation pattern (2 Gy x25, 5 treatments per week; total dose 50 Gy). The typical post-mastectomy target fields covered the ipsilateral lymph node regions in the axilla, the fossa supraclavicularis and along the arteria mammaria interna. Depending on the extent of the operation and/or the expected risk of local recurrence, the thoracic wall was also irradiated. In parallel with treatment A, an alternative treatment regimen was used (2.5 Gy x20, 4 treatments per week for 5 weeks; treatment B). This schedule still met the requirements related to limited RT capacity but was more in line with the conventional fractionation pattern of 5 weekly treatments of 2 Gy for 5 weeks. Treatment B was to be applied mainly in patients with primarily inoperable breast cancer, who could potentially be rendered operable by RT. From 1975 to 1991, 617 women received treatment B against the chest wall, with or without radiation to the regional lymph nodes. Of these 617 women, 155 were still alive in 1997. One-hundred-and-nineteen of these patients agreed to be included in the evaluation study and the same assessments of damage were performed as for the treatment A group.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5

The use of 5-FU vs. capecitabine was decided by the treating medical oncologist, who considered multiple factors, including patient reliability. RT was provided with a conventional 3-field technique or with intensity modulated RT (IMRT), according to institutional practice. The decision of whether to use a 3-field approach or IMRT was made by the treating radiation oncologist, taking into account patient anatomy and body habitus. Beginning in 2007, IMRT planning was used for patients with low-lying rectal tumors, or those with a history of prior pelvic surgery resulting in a larger volume of small bowel in the pelvis. By 2011, the majority of patients were treated using IMRT to minimize dose to the normal tissues. The 3-field approach used posterior-anterior (PA) and opposed lateral fields to treat the whole pelvis to 45 Gy, followed by a 5.4 Gy boost to the rectal tumor, to give a total dose of 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction. With IMRT, the pelvis was treated to 45 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction and the rectal tumor to 50 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, using an integrated boost. Contouring was performed according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus guidelines. Patients were treated in the prone position. An Aquaplast mold was used for immobilization. Some patients were also treated with a full bladder, to minimize the amount of small bowel in the field.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5

The clinical target volume, according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements guidelines, included primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (mesorectal, presacral, internal iliac vessels and obturator foramen). The four-beam ‘box technique’ was used, with the upper border extending to L5/S1. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU, administered alone or combined with other drugs. Seventy-six of the 125 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy that, in most cases, consisted of 4–6 cycles of 5-FU (370 mg/㎡ /day and leucovorin (LV) 100 mg/㎡/ day, bolus on days 1–5 every 28). The differences in preoperative and/or postoperative regimens used were related to: (a) the time when treatment was given during the initial study period, we routinely used 5-FU bolus with low-dose LV combined with external beam RT (45 Gy in 25 fractions), whereas more recent routine treatment has included continuous venous infusion of 5-FU and external beam RT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions); (b) enrolment of patients with different treatment regimens in clinical trials; (c) the different attitudes of the referring radiotherapy and oncology units.

All patients receiving nCRT were operated on within 8 weeks after radiotherapy ended. Radical surgery consisted mainly of sphincter_saving rectal resection or abdominoperineal resection both with total mesorectal excision. Regarding the selection of the operative procedure, we considered the distance of the lesion from the anus, the comorbidities of the patient, and the condition of the anal sphincter. Post surgery, patients were administered adjuvant chemotherapy protocol for 6 months performed preferably with 5-FU or a combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatinum (one of the followed regimens: mFolFOX6 – 200 mg/㎡ folinic acid (FA) day 1, 400 mg/㎡ 5-FU bolus day 1, continued infusion for 46 hours of 2,400 mg/㎡ 5-FU and 85 mg/㎡ oxaliplatin, 14/14 day cycle; CapeOx: 1,000 mg/㎡ capecitabine twice a day, days 1-14, 130 mg/㎡ oxaliplatin day 1, 21/21 day cycle; 5-FU/FA: 200 mg/㎡ FA day 1, 400 mg/㎡ 5-FU bolus day 1, continued infusion for 46 hours of 2,400 mg/㎡ 5-FU, 14/14 day cycle).

260	The eIF3a Arg803Lys genetic polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to and chemoradiotherapy efficacy in cervical carcinoma	English	2017	28359406	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28359406	Journal	\N	176	\N	176	\N	\N	\N	Three different radiotherapy treatments were provided. Intracavitary irradiation was administered to cervical carcinoma patients by treating with medial-dose-rate remote afterloading intracavitary irradiation with Ir-192. The dose prescription was to point “A,” which was a reference location 2 cm above the cervical os point of the uterine tandem and 2 cm lateral to the uterine source. The total radiological dose at point A was six to seven treatments with 36-42 Gy and was completed within 6-7 weeks. For patients with exophytic cervical carcinoma, the irradiation dose was decreased 10-25 Gy, and the dose prescription was 1 cm lateral to the uterine source. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was performed using a Co-60 teletherapy machine (Nuclear Power Institute of China, Chengdu, China). The range of the radiation field was 16-18 cm x 14 cm x 15 cm, the superior border of the pelvic field was the L4/5 border, and the inferior border was 4-5 cm below the upper margin of the pubic bone and did not exceed the center of the femoral head. A central shield (lead protection: 3-4 cm x 14-15 cm) was inserted in the radiation field after delivering 20e30 Gy to the whole pelvis, and radiation was then given to the pelvis at 15-25 Gy using an anterior and posterior 4-field box technique. Patients with para-aortic LNM received additional para-aortic irradiation, and patients with supraclavicular LNM received additional EBRTat the supraclavicular region. For chemotherapy, patients received DDP 20 mg 4 times every day by intravenous drip and 5-FU 4 g over 96 hours by continuous intravenous infusion. When the chemotherapy regimen began, patients also received radiotherapy. Patients received from three to six cycles of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5

For early oral cancers (T1/T0 with N0), wide excision with neck dissection was opted, whereas, in advanced cases (T3/T4, N0/N+), wide excision with reconstruction and neck dissection was carried out. Patients were then subjected to postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (external) based on the pathology report. Treatment wise, the majority of patients received radiation therapy alone (111/341, 35.7 %) or in combination with surgery and or chemotherapy (229/311, 74 %).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5
